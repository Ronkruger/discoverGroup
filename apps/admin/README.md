# Admin App (apps/admin)

This is a minimal admin application scaffold for DiscoverGroup.

How to run locally:
1. cd apps/admin
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

This admin app is intended for:
- CRUD tours (list, create, edit, delete)
- View transactions
- Run reports
- Theme editor (later)

This scaffold uses Vite + React. Replace with Next.js if you prefer server routes & preview integration.
